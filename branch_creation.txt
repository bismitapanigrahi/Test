Create Git Branch from Commit
$ git checkout -b <branch_name> <commit_sha>
$ git branch <branch_name> <commit_sha> (new branch)

To get commits SHA from your history ->
$ git log --oneline --graph
* 9127753 (HEAD -> master) Commit 3
* f2fcb99 Commit 2
* cab6e1b (origin/master) master : initial commit

To create a new Git branch from the second commit (f2fcb99) ->
$ git checkout -b feature f2fcb99
Switched to a new branch named 'feature' 

Using the “git log” command, you can verify that your branch was created from the second commit of your history.

$ git log --oneline --graph
